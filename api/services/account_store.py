"""
Account storage: create accounts, teams, team members, and usage records.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES
-------------------
All reads/writes of account data go through the functions below, so the
rest of the app never writes SQL directly. Each function has two paths:

  * DATABASE path  — when `DATABASE_URL` is set, rows are written to
                     Supabase/PostgreSQL (tables defined in db/schema.sql).
  * MEMORY path    — when no database is configured (local development),
                     rows live in Python dictionaries and vanish on restart.

The memory path exists ONLY so you can run and test the app without
setting up Supabase first. Never rely on it in production.

WHAT IS STORED (and what is NOT)
--------------------------------
Stored: name, email, account type, team membership, and a usage record per
download (file name, row count, runtime, amount) for billing.
NOT stored: the client's uploaded data. Files are processed in memory only.
